With social media rising as the new digital outlet for news and information, conforming to the traditional news outlets of printing and press, it is no surprise that the medium is biased and manipulated to probate certain aspects of politics in the elites' favor. By updating privacy policies, and content regulation, without consent, removing the actual face of terrorism and scale of destruction, in the current events is no big surprise. Meta with a biased policy of hate speech regulates any terms and phrases pointing towards the Zionist society's conduct, gives rise to misinformation, information hiding, and presents passive headlines protecting the business class investors. On the other hand, the content of mass murder, Muslim news outlets and independent activists is shadow banned and dropped from reach. The recent flood of blood bath and negative break out of violent content revealed automatically how much information is hidden from the genral masses, manipulating their world view. 

If certain regions, leaders and representatives are purposefully promoted in positive light, passive alteration of new headlines, and entertainment is bombarded on the weak minds, it will successfully strip the persons ability to think rationally. Consequently, targeting a certain group of people based on internalised hatred, memes, racial bias, superiority complex, saviour complex and victim mindset through modes of entertainment will create global instability and reduce empathy. Microsoft Azure, project Nimbus and explosive pagers are the practical result of this micro-psychological manipulation via algorithms. The under developed minds are fed trends and cultures to be mirrored as acceptable in society in these cult like activities without paying any logical heed to the abrupt rise, and where it leads to. 

Similarly unverified news and unchecked rage can stipulate regrettable actions for the future. Media outlets need to be strictly monitored.
