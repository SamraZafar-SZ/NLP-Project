**1. Thesis & Argumentation (Score: 2)**

The essay lacks a clearly stated thesis. While the prompt asks for an analysis of social media algorithms' impact on young adults' identity formation, the essay focuses primarily on the algorithms' role in shaping political narratives and intolerance.  This demonstrates a partial understanding of the prompt's scope, falling short of "developing a central idea with clear, specific, and well-supported claims," as required by the AAC&U VALUE rubric.  The argument, while present, is underdeveloped and lacks the depth needed for a strong analytical essay.


**2. Organization & Structure (Score: 2)**

The essay's organization is underdeveloped. The points made regarding political narratives and intolerance, while related, lack a cohesive structure and logical progression.  The essay does not effectively "organize ideas logically with clear transitions" (ETS TOEFL iBT). There is a lack of topic sentences and a clear paragraphing strategy supporting the main argument, leaving the reader to piece together the connections between ideas.


**3. Language Use (Score: 3)**

The language use demonstrates a grasp of fundamental grammatical structures, but the writing contains several stylistic issues and occasional inaccuracies. The sentence "The algorithms in question, are Machine Learning algorithms which learn from respective user's content consumption patterns or from agencies' content production and preferences" exemplifies a need for improved clarity and concision.  While the student's vocabulary is adequate, as measured by the Jacobs’ ESL Composition Profile, accuracy and precision in phrasing require attention.


**4. Engagement with Prompt (Score: 2)**

The essay only partially addresses the prompt. While the topic of social media algorithms is engaged, the focus shifts significantly from the formation of personal identity in young adults to the broader issue of political polarization. This shows limited "understanding of the task and responding effectively to all parts of it" (ETS TOEFL iBT Independent Writing). The essay’s central argument strays substantially from the original prompt’s core focus.


**5. Revision Potential (Score: 4)**

The absence of writing snapshots and keylogs prevents a detailed analysis of revision processes.  However, the final essay reveals that the student might benefit from pre-writing strategies to generate ideas and structure arguments effectively. The potential for significant improvement is high,  as suggested by the present rudimentary thesis and argumentation. Focused instruction on thesis construction, outlining, paragraph development, and proofreading would be beneficial.  The student shows an understanding of the core concepts but needs guidance in appropriately focusing and developing those concepts to answer the prompt.
