    "essay": "Part-time jobs can play an important role in allowing students to become independent and earn their own pocket money. This not only allows students to build self-reliance but also develop interpersonal and social survival skills. Like everything, part-time jobs also have both positive and negative impacts.\nFirstly, part-time roles allow students to gain real world work experience outside of their studies. This not only teaches them skills in addition to academics but also teaches them how money works in society. Moreover, students develop interpersonal skills like communication, conflict management, time management and financial literacy before they start a career. Once in our high school textbook, there was a chapter about how a student learnt invaluable lessons while doing a part-time role. It is important to mention that student life is far different from work life and the sudden transition can leave fresh out of college individuals quite shocked and disturbed to adapt the changes. Part-timing helps students learn professional skills and get a taste of real adult scenarios and professional life before they graduate. \nOn the flip side, part-timing also has its negatives for students. Students need to spend on average 8-10 hours in school or college and also top it up with self-study sessions. In this dynamic, if part-time jobs are also added to their schedules, it leaves not enough time for rest and recreation, which are also very important. This can lead to exhaustion very often among students. This also impacts the focus of students from their studies, tiring them to give their full potential to the academics. Additionally, part-time jobs can cause time deficit for students to participate in extracurriculars. Being a full-time student and also doing a part-time job are like having 2 jobs to juggle each day. Students not only need to focus on their college hours but also spend extra time for self-study sessions. \nConcludingly, even though part-time jobs play a crucial role in developing and polishing students' personalities and teaches them invaluable lessons and provide room for personal and professional growth, it can at times exhaust the students and strip them of the care-free experience tied to the student life.",
