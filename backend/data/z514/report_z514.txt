**1. Thesis & Argumentation (Score: 2)**

The essay lacks a clear, arguable thesis statement directly addressing the prompt's request to analyze social media's impact on young adults' identity formation.  The focus shifts to the dangers of social media algorithms and their influence on political narratives, failing to adequately address the multifaceted nature of the prompt ("Analyze the impactâ€¦considering both positive and negative influences"). The argument presented is underdeveloped and lacks supporting evidence.


**2. Organization & Structure (Score: 1)**

The essay demonstrates a significant lack of organizational structure.  Ideas are presented in a disjointed and illogical manner, lacking a coherent progression of thought. There is no discernible introduction, body paragraphs, or conclusion, resulting in a fragmented and incoherent argument ("Ideas are presented in a random order without logical connections"). The abrupt shifts between sentences further demonstrate this structural weakness.

**3. Language Use (Score: 3)**

While the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of sentence structure and vocabulary, there are numerous grammatical errors and instances of awkward phrasing.  The language is often imprecise and lacks the clarity and sophistication needed for effective academic writing ("Sentence structures are often incomplete or awkward"). However, the student attempts to use complex sentence structures, suggesting a willingness to engage with academic language.


**4. Engagement with Prompt (Score: 1)**

The essay demonstrates a significant misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the prompt. While mentioning social media, the student narrowly focuses on the negative influence of algorithms on political narratives, neglecting the broader impact on personal identity formation in young adults as instructed.  The essay largely ignores the positive aspects of social media, failing to engage with the core elements of the prompt.


**5. Revision Potential (Score: 4)**

The absence of writing snapshots and keylogs significantly limits the ability to analyze the student's revision process. However, the final essay itself reveals a potential for significant improvement.  The student's initial focus on algorithms suggests a potential line of inquiry, but this needs to be reframed and expanded to encompass the full scope of the prompt.  Guided revision should focus on developing a clear thesis statement, structuring the essay logically, providing relevant evidence, and addressing both positive and negative influences.  Instruction in creating a coherent argument, expanding upon existing ideas, and providing relevant evidence to support claims would improve future writing.
