## Essay Evaluation: Impact of Social Media Algorithms on Personal Identity

**Student:** [Student Name]

**Essay Topic:** Analyze the impact of social media algorithms on the formation of personal identity, considering both positive and negative influences.

**1. Thesis & Argumentation (Score: 2)**

The thesis statement is underdeveloped and lacks specific direction.  It mentions the role of algorithms in shaping opinions but doesn't clearly articulate the *analysis* of their impact on personal identity, failing to "develop a central idea with a clear thesis statement" (AAC&U VALUE).  The essay only superficially touches on the topic without offering a nuanced exploration of positive and negative influences.

**2. Organization & Structure (Score: 1)**

The essay lacks clear organization and structure.  It presents a single, underdeveloped paragraph that does not develop a logical progression of ideas or "present a clear, well-organized response" (ETS TOEFL iBT Integrated Writing). A more sophisticated structure with supporting arguments is needed to effectively analyze the complex relationship between algorithms and personal identity.

**3. Language Use (Score: 3)**

The language used is generally understandable but simplistic and lacks precision. While grammatically correct, the vocabulary is limited, resulting in a lack of sophisticated expression.  The writer demonstrates "adequate control of grammar and vocabulary to convey meaning" (Jacobsâ€™ ESL Composition Profile), but more varied and specific language is needed for effective academic writing.

**4. Engagement with Prompt (Score: 2)**

The essay partially addresses the prompt by acknowledging social media algorithms' influence. However, it fails to fully engage with the analytical aspects of the prompt, neglecting a balanced discussion of both positive and negative influences as required by the prompt's directive to consider "both positive and negative influences."  A more in-depth exploration of the multifaceted impact is needed to demonstrate complete engagement.

**5. Revision Potential (Score: 4)**

Given the absence of writing snapshots and keylogs, analysis of revision potential is limited to inference from the final essay. The underdeveloped nature of the essay suggests the student may have struggled to formulate a clear argument and organize their ideas.  The simplistic language indicates a need for vocabulary expansion and practice in expressing complex ideas.  The lack of structural development points to the need for practice in planning and outlining analytical essays.  Access to process data (snapshots and keylogs) would allow for a richer and more precise evaluation of the student's revision strategies and problem-solving approaches, potentially revealing moments of hesitation or confusion that could inform targeted interventions.  For example, identifying pauses during writing could signal points where the student struggled with conceptualization or articulation.  Analyzing revisions would highlight their effectiveness in strengthening the argument and improving clarity.
