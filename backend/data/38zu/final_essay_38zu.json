    "essay": "Social media algorithms play a vital role in forming the mental shape of users. A person spends a large portion of their time on social media daily. The algorithms which act as the main chefs of the daily social food we consume can either poison or cure our food, hence leading to shaping our minds. \nThe main issue with this design is that the algorithms is designed to learn our consumption pattern and push more of the same content our way. If a user consumes a negative post once, the algorithm learns it quickly and starts assuming it as a pattern and pushes more of the negativity our way. This throttles the efforts of users to break free from a particular content type, who are trying to change what content they want to consume. In cases of negative or dark content, this can lead to severe addictions. Not only addictions but it also hinders the way to recovery and blocks the hopes for breaking free from addictions.\n",
