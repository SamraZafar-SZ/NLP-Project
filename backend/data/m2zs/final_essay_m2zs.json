    "essay": "Social media algorithms play a vital role in forming the mental shape of users. A person spends a large portion of their time on social media daily. The algorithms which act as the main chefs of the daily social food we consume can either poison or cure our food, hence leading to shaping our minds.\nThe main issue with this design is that the algorithms is designed to learn our consumption pattern and push more of the same content our way. If a user consumes a negative post once, the algorithm learns it quickly and starts assuming it as a pattern and pushes more of the negativity our way. This throttles the efforts of users to break free from a particular content type, who are trying to change what content they want to consume. In cases of negative or dark content, this can lead to severe addictions. Not only addictions but it also hinders the way to recovery and blocks the hopes for breaking free from addictions. \nThis social media algorithm design can also become awfully impactful when there are filter bubbles. A particular narrative in political or controversial situations is supported while completely blocking the other side of the story. This acts as a propaganda by major media outlets which not only acts by destroying evidence to one whole side of the story but also causes to lower the tolerance threshold among people by keeping them unaware of the other narratives. Hence, diversified opinions are not much tolerated and this makes people more outrageous and less tolerant towards opinions. \nThe social algorithms hold great power on our current mental formation and in shaping people and their believes. This big responsibility, given in the hands of AI algorithms, which learn from mistakes and feedbacks, but can be controlled by vicious people or keep pushing their own faulty learning pattern in our feeds, play a very important yet dangerous role in forming our opinions and beliefs.",
